        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p> I am John and I have over 14 years of experience playing tennis.  Although I only started playing tennis when I reached my senior year of high 
            school, I learned quickly and was able to secure a spot playing on the varsity team.  Since then, I have been continuously learning and improving.  
            Ultimately, I am here to pass on my skill and experience.  Whether you are just a beginner hoping to get started playing tennis or you're already a 
            veteran looking to take your game to the next level, I believe I have the resources and experience to help you achieve your goals.  I have training 
            plans available that I can pare and tailor to your individual needs after a short consultation, free of charge! I offer both private lessons, one on 
            one, or group lessons if you prefer to bring along a friend.

        <h2> Personal Bio - A little bit about me! </h2>
        <p> My name is John and I am currently serving Active Duty in the United States Air Force.  I am currently stationed overseas in Japan.  
            I initially signed a four year contract and intended to use the GI Bill to return to school.  
            However, halfway through my contract, I was notified of a short tour assignment to Turkey with a follow-on assignment to Japan after.  
            I thought to myself there probably wouldn't be another opportunity for myself to experience and live in Japan, so I decided to jump on the opportunity.  
            Upon accepting the assignment, I had to extend my initial contract out another two and half years (about 30 months).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Being stationed overseas, I currently attend Southwestern College online.  
            I am majoring in Computer Science and will have about five classes remaining after I complete the current semester.  
            Upon completing my undergraduate degree in CS, I am looking to apply for a medical school preparatory program in which I can study full time for two years, 
            completing all the prerequisite courses for medical school, all the while still being paid as if I'm Active Duty.  
            Upon completion of the program and acceptance to medical school (either private or the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences), 
            I would be able to commission and continue serving as an officer and physician.  This is my end goal.
