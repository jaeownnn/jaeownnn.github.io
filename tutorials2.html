This will serve as the index page of my website.  My initial thought is to have it a webpage dedicated to offering tennis lessons. -->

        <h2> Forehand </h2>
        <p>
            The forehand is one of the most important weapons a player can develop.  Most people are comfortable using their forehands for most shots because
            they are using their dominant hand to hit the ball.  See below for some quick instructions on how to hit a forehand!
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Determine which hand is your dominant hand.  If you are right hand dominant, the ball will be coming to your right side.  If left hand dominant, the ball will be coming to your left side.</li>
            <li>Take small steps (called shuffling) to make sure you position yourself to hit on the correct side.</li>
            <li>Maintain eye contact with the ball</li>
            <li>Swing the racquet head to make contact with the ball.  You want to try and have the ball make contact with the center of the racquet (called the sweet spot).  This will ensure you the maximum amount of force transferred from the racquet to the ball.</li>
            <li>Follow through! Don't stop the racquet after you make contact with the ball, make sure you continue moving the racquet on its swing path. (The swing path usually ends with the racquet over your shoulder)</li>
        </ol>

            Below is a quick video of how you can start learning a beginner forehand.
