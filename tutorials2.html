        <h2> Forehand </h2>
        <p>
            <img src="federer_forehand.jpg" id="fhand">
            The forehand is one of the most important weapons a player can develop.  Most people are comfortable using their forehands for most shots because
            they are using their dominant hand to hit the ball.  See below for some quick instructions on how to hit a forehand!
        </p>

        <ol>

            <li>Determine which hand is your dominant hand.  If you are right hand dominant, the ball will be coming to your right side.  If left hand dominant, the ball will be coming to your left side.</li>
            <li>Take small steps (called shuffling) to make sure you position yourself to hit on the correct side.</li>
            <li>Maintain eye contact with the ball</li>
            <li>Swing the racquet head to make contact with the ball.  You want to try and have the ball make contact with the center of the racquet (called the sweet spot).  This will ensure you the maximum amount of force transferred from the racquet to the ball.</li>
            <li>Follow through! Don't stop the racquet after you make contact with the ball, make sure you continue moving the racquet on its swing path. (The swing path usually ends with the racquet over your shoulder)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Backhand </h2>
        <p>
            <img src="backhand.jpg" id="bhand">
            Another tool in a player's kit is the backhand.  A backhand may feel more awkward for a player at first since it requires the use of two hands.  However, once a player becomes more experienced, they may transition to a one-handed backhand.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Your backhand side is oppsite from your dominant hand side.  If you are right hand dominant, you will hit your backhand on your left side.  If left hand dominant, the ball will be hit from your right side.</li>
            <li>There are two types of backhands, the one-handed backhand and two-handed backhand.  For beginners, I recommend learning the two-handed backhand since it allows the player to control the racquet more easily.</li>
            <li>Take small steps (called shuffling) to make sure you position yourself to hit on the correct side.</li>
            <li>Maintain eye contact with the ball</li>

        <h2> The Serve </h2>
        <p>
            Before any forehands or backhands can be hit, a ball must be served.  Serving the ball is when the player has their foot behind the baseline and hits the ball over to the opposite service court.  Traditionally, the serve is hit with a overhead motion.
